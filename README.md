# AI Resources

Free lessons and articles where you can learn artificial intelligence topics (focused on machine learning and robotics) by working on your own from home!

I created this repository to collect links that I find useful in the field of free road maps and resources for AI. I will update regularly!

### The effects of artificial intelligence on human psychology

A person’s emotional intelligence determines his or her entire life. It is seen that individuals with high emotional intelligence, that is, people who understand the feelings of both themselves and others and use them correctly, are more successful in life. 

In the development of artificial intelligence, the role of high emotional intelligence is great. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a system or machine that can mimic human behavior and learn progressively from the data it receives to perform certain tasks.In modern times, it is true that in most areas of our lives, in our homes, in the office, in our daily routines, we benefit from artificial intelligence products. 

When most people say “artificial intelligence,” they think of the intelligent humanoid robots that have taken over the world. 

But the reality is that artificial intelligence is not designed to replace humans. Its purpose is to expand the boundaries of human capabilities and opportunities. 

Therefore, this technology is a valuable source of business. 

The advancement of technology causes the application areas of artificial intelligence to expand day by day. 

This is one of the questions that most people think.

“If artificial intelligence takes precedence over emotional intelligence, how will it affect our lives, human psychology?”
In every positive and negative situation we experience, we think, question and make decisions based on our emotional intelligence. 

If we think about an event we have experienced, we see that our previous experiences, emotions, behaviors, decisions, analyzes come to our aid at that time. 

Or we remember the behavior and experience of our friend, someone close, others, and we make our decision accordingly. 

So, will the robots trained by artificial intelligence, the algorithms it works with, etc. be able to implement this? It is also seen that the changes that artificial intelligence brings to human life worry some people because they affect the adaptation process.
Artificial intelligence creates a model by analyzing the given database and similar examples. Shows the results using this model. 

We humans learn about our environment by observing what is happening around us and we make decisions based on our feelings and thoughts. However, as artificial intelligence programs, robots and machines are taught the emotions gathered from these real-life experiences, the areas of application are expanding more. 

This limits people’s feedback for what to see.
One of the most common problems in recent times is Burnout syndrome.

The fact that people who work long hours without taking a break or resting in their career life or household chores are constantly in stressful situations causes burnout syndrome in them. 

Those who experience burnout syndrome form a more pessimistic outlook on life and may feel tired and hopeless all the time.

 Since burnout syndrome is more work- and work-stressed, career-induced, in such cases, robots, machines, etc. trained by artificial intelligence make the burnout syndrome less common, people work more efficiently, do not get too tired, and have time for themselves. 

And this situation plays a big and important role in human psychology.
